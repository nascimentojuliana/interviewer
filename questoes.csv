7,data_science_easy,How will you explain linear regression to a non-tech person?,"Linear Regression is a statistical technique of measuring the linear relationship between the two variables. By linear relationship, we mean that an increase in a variable would lead to increase in the other variable and a decrease in one variable would lead to attenuation in the second variable as well. Based on this linear relationship, we establish a model that predicts the future outcomes based on an increase in one variable.",https://img.olhardigital.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903133856-860x450.jpg,1

19,data_science_easy,"Explain bias, variance tradeoff.","Bias leads to a phenomenon called underfitting. This is caused by the introduction of error due to the oversimplification of the model. On the contrary, variance occurs due to complexity in the machine learning algorithm. In variance, the model also learns noise and other distortions that affect the overall performance of it. If you increase the complexity of your model, then the error will go down due to reduction in bias. However, after a certain point, the error will increase due to increasing complexity and addition of noise. This is known as bias-variance tradeoff. A good machine learning algorithm should possess low bias and low variance.",https://img.olhardigital.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903133856-860x450.jpg,1
20,data_science_easy,What is a confusion matrix?,"A confusion matrix is a table that delineates the performance of a supervised learning algorithm.

If the p-value is less than 0.05, then it means that we cannot reject the null hypothesis. However, if it is greater than 0.05, then we reject the null hypothesis.",https://img.olhardigital.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903133856-860x450.jpg,1
24,data_science_easy, Why don’t gradient descent methods always converge to the same point?,"This is because, in some cases, they reach to local or local optima point. The methods don’t always achieve global minima. This is also dependent on the data, the descent rate and origin point of descent.",https://img.olhardigital.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/20180903133856-860x450.jpg,1
